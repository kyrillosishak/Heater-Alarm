Heater Alarm\n
Consider a boiler in a petrochemical factory. Its temperature is measured every 3 minutes.
If the temperature <= 200oC, a green led will turn on.
If the 200 < temperature < 500oC, a yellow led will turn on.
If the temperature >= 500oC, a red led will turn on.
Write a program that reads the temperature every 3 minutes and shows the LED condition.
