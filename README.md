# Heater-Alarm
Heater Alarm <br/>
Consider a boiler in a petrochemical factory. Its temperature is measured every 3 minutes.<br/>
If the temperature <= 200oC, a green led will turn on.<br/>
If the 200 < temperature < 500oC, a yellow led will turn on.<br/>
If the temperature >= 500oC, a red led will turn on.<br/>
Write a program that reads the temperature every 3 minutes and shows the LED condition.<br/>
